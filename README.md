Project Description:
  This is a Front-End interface developed as part of the Semi Project in the EraaSoft Diploma. The project aims to create an educational platform for children with a simple and clear interface, organized layout,   using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap only.

Why did I choose this project?
  I chose a kids-focused project because it connects what I’m learning in Front-End development with my studies in Early Childhood Education.

What I focused on in this project:

  Creating an interface designed for children's education

  Writing clean and organized code

  Designing a responsive layout across all devices

  Fully meeting all Semi Project requirements


Technologies Used:

  HTML5

  CSS3
